# BeautifulLife.js [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/mc-suchecki/BeautifulLife.js/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/mc-suchecki/BeautifulLife.js)
Another JavaScript implementation of Conway's Game of Life, this time a nice looking one. Created as an effort to
learn ECMAScript 6.

### Browser support
Currently, due to ECMAScript 6 support, running BeautifulLife is available only in Google Chrome, Apple Safari and 
Microsoft Edge. Support for ES6 should be added to Mozilla Firefox and Opera soon, therefore allowing the simulation
to run on these browsers. Please note that the simulation will not run on any Internet Explorer ever because of lack of
ES6 support. Please use a proper browser instead.

### How to run
Just download the files and open index.html in a browser. Online demo coming soon.
